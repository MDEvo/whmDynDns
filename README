What is whmDynDns?

whmDynDns is a PHP script which takes advantage of the WHM JSON API in order to update DNS zone 
records for pointing subdomains to a server with a dynamic IP address. It can be run using CRON and 
based on your configuration will add/update A records when your public IP address changes.


Why was it created?

Although I have my production websites hosted remotely I wanted to be able to point development 
versions to my own server hosted at home with a dynamic IP address. i.e. http://www.myapplication.com 
is hosted remotely but http://dev.myapplication.com is hosted locally on my own machine. After a little searching 
I found the WHM JSON API and had to have some fun with it!


How to use whmDynDns?

Edit whmDynDns.php and configure the following options:

Set this to your WHM Admin login
$username = "YourUsername";

Set this to your WHM Admin password
$password = "YourPassword";

Set this to your WHM Login URL (2087 is the default WHM SSL port)
$whmUrl = "https://yourwebsite.com:2087/";

Add one more more websites to scrape our IP from (one or more as array)
Included in the "server" folder is very simple PHP script you can upload
to a external server to get your remote IP.

$websites[] = "http://www.yourwebsite.com/ip.php";
$websites[] = "http://www.ipchicken.com";

Add your host names here (one or more as array).
'name' is the subdomain, if left empty, it will add/update a record for the root domain itself (ex, yourdomain.com.)
'zone' is the domain
'ttl' is the time to live of the record, if left empty, iit will be set as the DNS server default
$zones[] = array('name' => 'sub1', 'zone' => 'yourzone.com');
$zones[] = array('name' => 'sub2', 'zone' => 'yourzone.com', 'ttl' => 300);
$zones[] = array('name' => '', 'zone' => 'yourzone.com');

Set your TimeZone
date_default_timezone_set('America/New_York');


Schedule with CRON

Setup whmDynDns.php to run at regular intervals using CRON (via 'crontab -e', etc.) and pipe to log!

i.e. Every hour would look like:

01     *     *     *     *     php /home/phpguy/cron/whmDynDns.php >> /var/log/whmDynDns.log
