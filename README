What is whmDynDns?

whmDynDns is a PHP script which takes advantage of the WHM JSON API in order to update DNS zone 
records for pointing subdomains to a server with a dynamic IP address. It can be run using CRON and 
based on your configuration will add/update A records when your public IP address changes.


Why was it created?

Although I have my productions websites hosted remotely I wanted to be able to point development 
versions to my own server hosted at home with a dynamic IP address. i.e. http://www.myapplication.com 
is hosted remotely but http://dev.myapplication.com is hosted locall on my own machine. After a little searching 
I found the WHM JSON API and had to have some fun with it!


How to use whmDynDns?

Edit whmDynDns.php and configure the following options:

# Set this to your WHM Admin login
# $username = "YourUsername";

# Set this to your WHM Admin password
# $password = "YourPassword";

# Set this to your WHM Login URL (2087 is the default WHM SSL port)
# $whmUrl = "https://yourwebsite.com:2087/";

# Add one more more websites to scrape our IP from (one or more as array)
# Included in the "server" folder is very simple PHP script you can upload
# to a external server to get your remote IP.
#
# $Websites[] = "http://www.yourwebsite.com/ip.php";
# $Websites[] = "http://www.ipchicken.com";

# Add your host names here (one or more as array). 'name' is the subdomain and 'zone' is the domain
# $Zones[] = array('name' => 'dev', 'zone' => 'myzone.com');
# $Zones[] = array('name' => 'sub', 'zone' => 'yourzone.com');

# Set your TimeZone
# date_default_timezone_set('America/New_York');


Schedule with CRON

Setup whmDynDns.php to run at regular intervals using CRON (via 'crontab -e', etc.) and pipe to log!

i.e. Every hour would look like:

01     *     *     *     *     php /home/phpguy/cron/whmDynDns.php >> /var/log/whmDynDns.log
